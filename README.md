## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Load Data
- **From CSV:** Upload your CSV file directly through the dashboard interface.
- **From Google Sheets:**
  1. Enter the URL of the Google Sheets document.
  2. Ensure your [Google API credentials](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart) (`credentials.json`) are properly set up.

### Step 2: Perform Search Queries
- Use the dashboard to input search terms.
- The tool integrates with [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to automatically fetch relevant data.

### Step 3: AI-Powered Data Processing
- Extract meaningful insights from raw data using Groq's AI models.
- View summaries and prepare the data for further analysis.

### Step 4: Export Results
- Download the output as a CSV file.
- Sync the processed data back to a Google Sheet for easy sharing.

## üìã Usage Guide

The **AI Data Extraction Dashboard** is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Below are the step-by-step instructions for using the dashboard, connecting Google Sheets, and setting up search queries.

### 1. **Running the Dashboard**

Once you‚Äôve installed all dependencies and set up the project (refer to the Setup Instructions above), you can start the dashboard by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the dashboard in your default web browser.

## Setup & Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-dashboard.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Connecting Google Sheets

1. Create a Google Sheets document
2. Set up Google Sheets API credentials:
   - Visit the Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project and enable Google Sheets API
   - Download `credentials.json`
3. Place `credentials.json` in project root
4. Enter Google Sheets URL in dashboard
5. Authorize API access when prompted

## Uploading CSV Files

To upload a CSV file:

### Step 1: 
Click on the "Upload CSV" button in the dashboard.
### Step 2: 
Select the file from your local directory.
### Step 3: 
The CSV will be uploaded, and the data will appear in the dashboard for further processing.

## Search Queries

The dashboard allows you to perform web searches using AI-powered search capabilities. To set up a search query:

### Step 1: 
Navigate to the search section of the dashboard.

### Step 2: 
Enter the search query in the text input field.

For example:

If you want to search for a particular product or service, type something like: "Best data visualization tools for 2024".
If you want to extract specific information, be more specific: "Top Python libraries for data analysis".
### Step 3: 
Click the "Search" button, and the dashboard will retrieve data using SerpAPI.
### Step 4: 
Once the search is complete, the results will be processed by the AI model (Groq), which will extract relevant insights and display them in a structured format.

### Example Queries
- `"Identify the Country in which the Names called Ferrell LLC, Mckinney, Riley and Day, Hester Ltd , Holder-Sellers , Mayer Group are Located"`

### Supported Formats
- CSV
- Google Sheets (automatic sync)

### üîó API Keys and Environment Variables
### Step 1: Create the .env file
In your project‚Äôs root directory (the same level as your app.py), create a new file called .env.
Inside the .env file, store your API keys and other necessary environment variables in the following format:
```bash
SERPAPI_KEY=
GOOGLE_CREDS_PATH=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```
### Step 2: Access the variables in your Python code
To access these environment variables in your Python code, you‚Äôll need to use the python-dotenv package, which allows Python to load environment variables from the .env file.
Install python-dotenv: Add python-dotenv to your requirements.txt file, or install it directly via pip:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
Load the environment variables (Testing) in your app.py or other Python files where you need the keys:
```bash
# Import the required libraries
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from the .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access the variables
SERPAPI_KEY = os.getenv("SERPAPI_KEY")
GOOGLE_CREDS_PATH = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CREDS_PATH")
GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")

# Use these variables in your code
print(SERPAPI_KEY, GOOGLE_CREDS_PATH, GROQ_API_KEY)
```

### Optional Features
- Real-time data filtering
- Custom sorting options
- Export capabilities
- Google Sheets synchronization
